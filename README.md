# Burger

An app I created to practice express-handlebars. Simply type in a burger you would like to eat and it will get added to the database and rendered on the page. If you devour the burger, the database will be updated with the burger as devoured. Simply press delete after the burger has been devoured and the burger will be removed from the database to make room for more burgers!
